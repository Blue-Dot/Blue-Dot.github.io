**More restaurants, python, but without a computing teacher**

 

Starting Point - Half a system designed to take orders for a restaurant, and some resources on Google Classroom

Target - To complete the system

Completed? - No, but nearly

***

Pre-rant

I did it again. I left my homework to quite late, the night before. The worst part: I didn't need to. I could have done it earlier, as I had time, but all I did was procrastinate. Furthermore, it meant the post had to be a lot shorter. Next time, I am *going* to do my homework over the weekend. Now for the post:

What did I do this lesson?

This lesson was a cover lesson, so that means the teacher wasn't there. This meant we had to use our initiative a lot more. We used the post on Google Classroom to direct our learning, but we still had to be more *independant*. We had to complete two worksheets on classroom, which I found quite easy, and subsequently could do without the supporting slides. Maybe next time, try to find a way to challenge myself?

Then we went on to work on our restaurant systems, like last week. This is fairly self-explanatory, as it was the same as last week (check out last week's post). Minor improvements were made, such as answering questions by asking questions, and mostly it was good and efficient on the whole. Most issues last week were solved.

I urgently need to go, but the main target for this week : *Don't do the blog post the night before it is due in!!*
