    <td>My 'sticky footer had an issue. The bottom of the footer was about 40px of the bottom of the screen, leaving just background underneath. Despite turning ‘stickiness' (fixed) off, the bottom gap was still there. After much fiddling around, I finally found the answer. In my footer, the text and the github icon have different classes: ‘footerleft’ and ‘footerright’. Footer left, with the ‘Made by someone called Max’, had a height of 80px. I got rid of it, and bingo! My footer was fixed. I also fiddled around with the fonts using: ‘https://designshack.net/articles/typography/10-more-great-google-font-combinations-you-can-copy’</td>

  <tr>
    <td>This lesson, I found that my main method of working was experimenting. In other words, just fiddling about. Later I found that even if I had asked or searched for the answer, nothing else could have worked. So I think that using a strategy of experimentation, I completed the task set.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I found that the main limiting factor to my learning was my lack of ability to think outside the box. The reason for this is that the solution to my problem was quite simple, but it took a lot of time to figure it out. Also, my lack of logical thinking was limiting, as I discovered I was sometimes checking things again and again.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As the lesson was completed at home, I found that I worked quite effectively. However, I did spend a lot of time on one target, and I think that I should have worked more efficiently and used less time to complete lots of things.</td>
