I coloured and bordered the table, completed the header and footer, and filled the about page. Overall, this was a good lesson.</td>

    <td>Despite what the previous box, I think that I could have worked more effectively if I had concentrated on my own work. A lot of progress happened at home, so in future, I need to focus on my own work at school. However, I think that helping others is also vital, so getting the balance correct is vital.</td>
