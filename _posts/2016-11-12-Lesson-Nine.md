**Encryption and Cyphers**

 

Starting Point - With basic knowledge of one way password encryption, but with no knowledge of the history of encryption

Target - By the completion of my homework, to have a beautiful presentation on the similarities of different encryption methods

Completed? - Yes, but after a excessive amount of time (close to 3 or 4 hours)

What did I do this lesson?

To start of with, after submitting our blogs on Google Classroom, we got our marks back. I got this:

<img src="https://blue-dot.github.io/_images/Lesson_Nine/Google_Classroom_score" alt="9 out of 9" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

I am very proud of this score. Despite the minimalist design, this blog took a lot of effort to make. This is because of my limited website building knowledge. But after 8 weeks, my hard work finally payed of! After receiving our score, we were asked to improve our work. With full marks, there wasn't much I could do. The two things I could have done to improve my blog would be to add relevant images, and to make my website more mobile friendly, the first of which I have already completed! However, instead of working on my own blog, I dedicated these 15-20 minutes to helping others fix problems in their blog. This may have been a poor decision, as it didn’t help me much. Next time, maybe I should focus on my own work, by splitting the time between helping others and doing private work.

Next, after the feedback, we were asked to sign onto the <a href="http://my.dynamic-learning.co.uk">Dynamic Learning Website</a> which we used last year. After forgetting our school's center ID (Ugh) and a remember your password resend link, I was on. Maybe next time I could remember the center ID?

Then, aI navigated the site, and using my past knowledge navigating other websites, I read the two text pages in our assignment. After I had finished I read through them, ensuring I had really *read* them. This was a good idea and I am very glad I did so. It helped a lot in homework. I think that I should do this next lesson too.

Overall throughout the lesson, there was not very much to say. I worked well and proactively, though maybe I should have focused more on my own task as opposed to helping others, and managed/allocated my time more efficiently. Homework is a completely different matter though…

For homework, we were asked to, "research the use of cyphers through time and prepare a *short* presentation on their similarities." To put it simply, I forgot about the word short.

Firstly, being the banana I am, I started by creating my title slide. This should have been the shortest slide to create, surely? No. I started by entering my title, Cyphers and their similarities, but then I discovered this new button called 'Explore'.

/Explore

This brought up a pop up menu with loads of different layout and styling options. I presume that this is meant to make work more productive and efficient. However, I always insist on not using templates/themes and producing all the formating myself. It makes the end outcome more rewarding. So, instead of using one of the inbuilt themes, I used these as inspiration for my design. This took a lot longer than expected: 30 minutes to create a simple design. And an extra 10 minutes to chose the colours for it. 40 minutes is way too long to spend designing a title page! I need to speed up my formatting. One method I could use to do this would be the Type, Edit, Format method. This would enable me to get all the content out of the way and enable me to format more effectively. Also, the end result would be better, as the formating would be tailored to the content, instead of some generic format. Hopefully I will do this next time.

The same story goes on and on for multiple slides. Apparently I don't learn from my mistakes. After a few slides, I realise my mistake finally. I start using the type, edit, format (or content, content, format, format) method, and my productivity rises (yay!)

/Productivity

And after lots of work, research and dedication, I finally finish my presentation. I don't know if it is because I am tired, but I think it doesn't look too bad. It should have taken me a lot less time, but I got there in the end. It was a half hour project, but it turned into a three hour project. I should have focused on the content rather than the looks, but it still worked out. 

Now I should probably go do some other homework...
