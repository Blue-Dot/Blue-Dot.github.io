  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I changed multiple (things mainly to do with styling) which were not pre-programmed into the Jekyll template, including:
Changing the navbar to blue
Deleting the separating line between navbar and body
Making a 'sticky' footer
Writing "Made by someone called Max" on the footer
Formating that</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I again found that I learnt best on my own, however helping others learn did consolidate my own learning. For example, helping my neighbors in turn helped me remember how to create a ‘sticky’ footer. Also, as our teacher allowed us to work more independently, it helped me experiment on my own. Overall, another good lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Last lesson, I mentioned that helping others limited my learning. This lesson, the same thing limited me again, but less so this time. This lesson, the main thing that limited me this lesson was my unreasonable aims. For example, it took a lot of Google searches and time to find out what the separating between the navbar and body was. Despite this, it was still a good lesson.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Again, I think this was a good lesson and there is not much to improve. However, I still could improve by trying easier things. However, this is quite dangerous and I need to be careful because I could switch to the other extreme and only do the easiest things, not challenging myself.</td>
