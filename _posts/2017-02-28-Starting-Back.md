**Scratch and Fun**

 

Starting Point - After a term(ish) of drama, and an empty mind, and creativity

Target - To learn about python, and recap the main points

Completed? - Yes, but it was too easy

***

What did I do this lesson?

The first thing to note is that the way our lessons are structured means that I had a large break from doing computer science at school, instead doing drama. Now, I am back to doing computer science. The projects I have been working on include a 3d rendering project in Scratch, messing around with git on the command line, and trying to run Linux and experimenting with BIOS. However, these will hopefully be mentioned later in a different blog post.

I was given a robot, of sorts, at the beginning of the lesson, and told to, with a friend, to assemble and work it. Instead of using the manual (that would be boring and too easy), we decided to just experiment, flicking switches, and laying things down. We figured out that it moved depending on which colour it was on, due to the included 'map', and so we got it working. I reckon this was a good, sensible use of our problem solving skills.

Next, the class was given a recap and basic intro to python, but as I had recently used it in the last holidays, I felt as if I could go on to something else. Initiative! I continued work on my 3D Scratch project. I got very, very frustrated however, as it didn't work, as I was using trigonometric functions, which I didn’t fully understand. I even tried starting again, and building it up from Scratch. I never got it to fully work as I wanted it to, but I got close. I think this is a bad example of perseverance - I wasn’t trying hard enough, or thinking about the issue logically. 

On the other hand, I did successfully complete the learning objective, by helping others and revising Python at the same time. This was a good example of multitasking and productivity. Overall, it was mostly a successful lesson, though I probably should have thought about the problems I encountered further.
