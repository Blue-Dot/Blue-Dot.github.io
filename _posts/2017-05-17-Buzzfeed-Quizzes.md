What did I do this lesson?

We started of by completing a few 'Buzzfeed quizzes' on their website. I chose a few short ones, so that I could get through more, and see how they worked. Then we went to the front of the class and discussed how they worked. I gave active contributions, but maybe I could have thought more outside the box, giving more original ideas and thoughts.

Then we were told to make our own quiz questions, without the code, like buzzfeed. This was for the majority of the lesson, and I did not use this time very effectively. I was stuck for ideas, and so I started doing the code. This was a bad idea: we had to finish (or do) the questions for homework. Also, the way I did the code was inefficient, and we would be helped next lesson.

Homework was efficient though. Once I had slept on my lack of ideas, and searched the internet for inspiration, I had come up with and idea. I created a Google Sheets, and created an efficient method for coming up with questions and answers. 

I did do my blog quite late, though I was very busy throughout the week. I could have done it earlier though.
