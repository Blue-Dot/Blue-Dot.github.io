What did I do this lesson?

Firstly, we were told what our brief was. We had to make a system for a restaurant to allow customers to order, to get a receipt and to keep track of stock. We thought about inputs and outputs, such as who would want to use the system. I think that in this part of the lesson, I was very focused, answering questions and thinking of original ideas.

Then we went on to actually making the thing. I used my previous knowledge of python to create an advanced system, using dictionaries and the like. I did have to use google search a couple of times, but I think that that was a good use of resources. I am pleased with my overall product, but I could have made it more user friendly, and less easy to break by typing in the wrong answer. 

I helped people by quite a large amount, but I felt as if it was necessary, and it helped me to recap python further. My helping strategy was good mostly, but for a few people, I could have helped them less, but asked more questions.

The main concern however, would be homework. I wasn't organised whatsoever, so this post, and the few improvements I did, were executed at the last minute, so hopefully next week, I will be able to do my homework early in the week.
