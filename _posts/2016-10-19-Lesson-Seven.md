Multiple Sheets

Starting Point - With a working, formatted spreadsheet, with multiple, not linked pages

Target - To have multiple sheets, interlinked, allowing my 'company' to enter data, and the computer to figure out the rest.

Completed? - Yes, I believe so. I have many sheets, and some formulas interlink them.

What did I do this lesson?

This lesson, I worked continued to work on my spreadsheet. I:

Created **multiple sheets**, such as 'Costs', ‘Profit and Loss’ and ‘Employees’ among others.

Entered **data into those sheets**, using formulas wherever possible. An example of this is where the 'Costs' sheet required to take into account the cost of the employees. I referenced it by using =Employees!F31.

Mixed up the **formating**. An example of this is changing the header to be taller and to have a solid block colour.

For homework, I:

Completed my spreadsheet, completing the formatting and data.

As I had surplus time, I decided to **work on my blog**. I abandoned the template in which our teacher gave us, replacing it with a slicker version. This post is the first example of this.

Despite **abandoning the template**, I still continued to use Google Docs. My reasoning is simple: if something were to go wrong with Github, I would still have a backup of all my blog posts. On the other hand, the convenience of markdown tempted me to finish my post in markdown, on Github. Gabriel - the tool which allows me to convert a Google Doc to markdown - is not compatible with certain things, such as lists, which I can now use, through **editing in markdown.**

I also made a minor change to my header: the .site-description is now black, not grey.

What effective strategies were used?

This lesson, I think I worked very effectively. I established a **good ratio of time between helping others, and working independently**. My focus was again very good, evidence for this is the amount of work accomplished in the lesson. As a large element of the lesson was largely dependent on **active listening**. I feel I didn't start the lesson with great skill in that area, but as the lesson continued, I feel I developed well. On top of this, my use of hotkeys, like RETURN and TAB, were good. My **resourcefulness also flourished**; I didn’t use Google much at all. The Sheets Help section provided me with resources, which were faster and more reliable than other sources.

What could I have improved?

Overall, this was a good and effective lesson. However, I could still work on my **perseverance skills**. Sheets is a complex and advanced program (when used properly) and I struggled to format my work nicely. However, when I got home, I **dedicated myself to the task**, and finally finished with the rewarding pleasure of something that I am proud of. Another skill which I could have improved would be my **making links** skill. I could have potentially found a similarity between what I was doing, and Python, making my work more efficient. However, overall this was a very **productive lesson**.
