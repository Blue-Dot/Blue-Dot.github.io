**Apps, Hangman and Websites**

 

Starting Point - A not functioning version of hangman, An app called called 'Swift Playgrounds' and a design mockup of a website

Target - To make my hangman version work

Completed? - Yes, in homework time

***

What did I do this lesson?

Firstly, I started out with showing our teacher what a new app, 'Swift playgrounds' does. It is an app made by Apple to help teach Swift. I thought this could be useful to the classroom, and teaching computing. I spent too long testing it, and messing around in it though, exhausting its usefulness.

In homework time, I quickly decided, after looking at my old hangman, that it would be more efficient and effective to completely remodel it. It was inefficient, and difficult to add more functionality. I remade it quickly, copy and pasting parts from the old, to create a quick and easy hangman function.

I then, using a design I made quite some time ago, started to make a website on repl.it. This refreshed my html and css skills, which I had started to forget. Hopefully I will finish it for next homework, and then use it to replace my old blog.

The main concern however, would be homework. I made the hangman / website over the weekend. However, I wasn't organised whatsoever, so this post, was executed at the last minute, so hopefully next week, I will be able to do my homework early in the week.
