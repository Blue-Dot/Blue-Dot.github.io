**More python, and Hangman**

 

Starting Point - Python Knowledge, and some work on Google Classroom

Target - To complete the last challenge in the 'challenge booklet' - 

Completed? - No, but nearly

Pre-rant

I did it *again*. I'm sorry. But this is getting ridiculous now. I will endeavour to do this post the lunchtime after the lesson. Refer to earlier posts if one doesn’t understand...

What did I do this lesson?

This lesson was also a cover lesson, so that means the teacher wasn't there. This was the same as last lesson.  This meant the lesson was more prescriptive and less free. We used the post on Google Classroom to direct our learning, but I used my initiative. The earlier challenges were quite easy, so I skipped to the last one - to create hangman in python.  However, I feel like I wasn’t very resilient, and I was trying too hard on one problem, instead of using computational thinking.

Furthermore, I was helping people too much. My time management wasn't very good. I felt as if most of my work was helping others. Also, without the teacher, the atmosphere was more relaxed, so I felt more inclined to talk to others, and not 100% concentrate on my work.

Overall, I think it wasn't a very good lesson. Hopefully next lesson I will be more independent and focused.
