    <td>This lesson, we were going to start using spreadsheets. We had to create a customer receipt, and it had to do as many calculations as possible. I learnt about the =SUM(), =VLOOKUP(), +, -, *, / and =if(x, x, if()) functions. I successfully created a customer receipt, and even had enough time to format it. I changed the font, margins, colours and spacing. Afterwards, for homework, I pushed myself by creating a company receipt, taking things into account like costs, and income. My spreadsheet can be found at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wUKhHruzBN7f4djRke0gPQcLy_0XdAU3B7Dk2CKLrjQ/edit?usp=sharing</td>

    <td>My work was very good this lesson, as I focused on the task set, only giving help to people who needed it. I found this lesson, my helping abilities were well used. Instead of giving anyone the answer, I actively helped them to figure the answer out themselves. My focus was massively improved because when I started doing something, I would not do anything until I had completed that task. Overall, this made me quite productive.</td>

    <td>I believe there is not much I could improve on for next lesson. However, I still could work faster by using the type, edit, format method. This would involve typing everything quickly, without correcting mistakes, then correcting all the mistakes, and making sure everything works, and only then start making things look beautiful. This still was a very good lesson.</td>
