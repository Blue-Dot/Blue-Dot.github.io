**And the Vlookup formula**

 

Starting Point - With a presentation of various cyphers and their similarities

Target - To concentrate on others presentations, and to present my presentation well

Completed? - No, because I didn't have a chance to present mine.

What did I do this lesson?

This lesson I found quite difficult to write about, as the lesson was fairly uneventful. We were asked to upload our work to Google Classroom, and then we **presented our work** to the class. My uploading was slightly more complicated however. As you may know, if you read my blog post last week, I made two versions of my cypher presentations. A quick note explaining this was necessary, which took longer than it should have. Overall though, it wasn't a big deal. Unfortunately, I didn’t present mine, but I couldn’t have taken any other action to prevent this.

Homework was to **revise the =VLOOKUP formula**. I left this quite late (Late Sunday, when our lesson is on Wednesday) and only did this blog post the night before. This is understandable however, as I have a very big music exam on Friday; I needed to do lots of practice. I still had enough time to do a very detailed homework though, which I am quite pleased about. I started the task of revision by watching a short video (2 - 3 minutes long). This was an effective revision method as it helped me to recap my previous knowledge.

Next, I decided to practice what I had learnt. I made a new sheet called Vlookup and tried to create a search function. For my starting data, I tried to use car brands. This was included in the *Google Sets* (Autocomplete). I tried and tried and tried to get Google to generate Car brands for me, only to learn, after a lot of research, that that feature hasn't worked since 2014. Sigh. I typed 20 car brands out by hand instead. I then gave them all an index (number) to aid the search. My search 'bar’ consisted of two main boxes: one for the search query, and one for the maths. The code went like this:

=VLOOKUP(G5, B:D, 3, TRUE)

This was fairly simple to figure out, and it worked. It searched the search query in the table, and returned the index. I then went on to create a new column next to the indexes with the code:

=IF($I$10=D5, "<--", ".")

This compared the vlookup formula to the index of the car, and if it was the same, it would display an arrow, else it would display a full stop. This made the search more effective. Then I decided to use **Conditional Formating**, a skill I learnt in my primary school. I thought this was a good use of applying past knowledge. Using the intuitive UI, I made the spreadsheet highlight a cell, when it had a '<' in it, or an arrow. At this point, my spreadsheet was nearing completion.

This is where I started to fall. I thought to myself, "this search is not very useful, as it doesn't return anything, and it would be easier to do it by hand." So, I decided to add some different information. After much time scouring the internet, and trying to find more car makers, I finally landed on the world bank. I downloaded a Global GDP spreadsheet. I imported it into Google Sheets (File>Import) and cut down a lot of information. This whole process took a lot longer than it should have. I need to stop procrastinating! Then, I added a second column, with the country’s codes. Finally, I added an exact search and a rough search and did a bit of formatting. Once again, my homework took longer than it should have. Sigh.
